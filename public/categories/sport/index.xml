      <description>&lt;p&gt;The TCS London Marathon is one of the most iconic running events in the world. Each year, more than 40,000 runners take on the 26.2-mile (42.2 km) route through the streets of London, from Greenwich Park to Buckingham Palace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This year, the marathon took place on Sunday, April 27th, guiding runners along a 26.2-mile route through the heart of the capital. The race began in Greenwich, with participants setting off from one of five start lines based on their assigned wave. From there, the course passed some of London&amp;rsquo;s most iconic landmarks, including the Cutty Sark, Tower Bridge, and Canary Wharf, offering scenic views and unforgettable crowd support.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
