The TCS London Marathon is one of the most iconic running events in the world. Each year, more than 40,000 runners take on the 26.2-mile (42.2 km) route through the streets of London, from Greenwich Park to Buckingham Palace.

This year, the marathon took place on Sunday, April 27th, guiding runners along a 26.2-mile route through the heart of the capital. The race began in Greenwich, with participants setting off from one of five start lines based on their assigned wave. From there, the course passed some of London's most iconic landmarks, including the Cutty Sark, Tower Bridge, and Canary Wharf, offering scenic views and unforgettable crowd support.

The route then turns west, where runners pass the Tower of London, continue along the Thames Embankment, and enjoy the final stretch past Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. The marathon concluded on The Mall, right in front of Buckingham Palace, creating one of the most memorable finishes in the world.

This year, the TCS London Marathon had a record-breaking 56,640 runners finish the race, which is amazing. Every runner had the chance to get a Guinness World Record certificate for participating in this challenge.

## Why I Ran

Some people run for a personal challenge, others to break records, and many to raise money for causes they care about. I was here to gain experience, and I was super motivated knowing that I could also support a charity I deeply identify with.

I ran this year's marathon as part of Team NSPCC, a UK charity that protects children from abuse and supports families across the country.

NSPCC allowed me to participate in this event for the first time. I applied through their charity runner program, and they also provided incredible support for eight months straight.

If you're wondering how to run the London Marathon for the first time and you don't get selected in the ballot, I highly recommend going through a charity like the NSPCC. You get a place in the race and a full support system. If you're able to fundraise and think you can achieve your target, go for it!

## The Training Journey: 8 Months of Preparation

I started my training journey eight months before race day. NSPCC paired us with a professional coach, Benjamin Barwick, who guided our entire group through training.

Benjamin helped us with:
*   A personalized training plan for each of us.
*   Weekly updates and one-on-one check-ins.
*   A strong focus not just on finishing the race, but also on avoiding injuries and recovering well afterward.

In this plan, a post-race recovery strategy was included so we could continue running and stay active after the marathon (after proper rest, of course) instead of collapsing and giving up forever, hehehe.

We also had a group chat with all NSPCC runners. Our coaches, including another amazing one, Steven Campell, were always checking our training logs, keeping us on track. We shared our experiences, motivated one another, celebrated small victories, and supported each other through the tough moments.

## Race Day: A Celebration of Life and Strength

But the most emotional part for me was the start. After saying goodbye to my family, I stood at the starting line, surrounded by thousands of strangers who somehow felt like friends. My eyes filled with tears. I hadn't taken a single step yet; I was scared, excited, and so happy that the day had finally arrived.

I didn't know how my body would handle 26.2 miles, and that uncertainty was my biggest fear. But I took a deep breath... and started running.

The race was full of joy and emotion: bands and orchestras playing along the course, children giving high-fives, posters that made me smile and cry, spectators shouting my name, and volunteers cheering us on at every water station.

I ran next to people from all over the world, each carrying their own story. And somehow, we were all moving forward together.

I had tough moments,heat, cramps, heavy legs, but I also discovered a deep strength I didn't know I had. The crowd gave me energy when I was tired. The cheers felt like fuel.

I finished the marathon in 4 hours and 44 minutes.

## Gratitude, Always

Throughout the race, I felt grateful for my body, which carried me; my family, who was there all the time; the people who supported my fundraising target; the NSPCC; our amazing coaches, who guided me to the start line; and the club runners, who motivated me so strongly.
